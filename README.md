# Getting Started with Create React App and GrapeJS

This project has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes [GrapeJS](https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs), a powerful web builder framework.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following npm scripts:

### `npm start`

Run this command to start the application in development mode. The application, including GrapeJS functionalities, will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will automatically reload upon making edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for detailed information.

### `npm run build`

Build the application for production in the `build` folder. This process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance. The resulting files are minified and include unique hashes. Your application, integrated with GrapeJS, is then ready for deployment.

For more details on deployment, see the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once ejected, there is no going back!**

If you find the need to customize the build tool and configuration choices, you can use this command to eject. Ejecting copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, granting you full control. After ejecting, all commands, except `eject`, still work, but they now refer to the copied scripts, allowing for further customization.

It's important to note that ejecting is not obligatory. The curated feature set is suitable for small to mid-sized deployments, and you may choose not to use this feature.
